So back with the second week experiences. Phew!!! A week that was.

Continuing last week's works, I had to study the Giraph API, to write my own programs following the BSP model. I executed Pagerank on Giraph, on two datasets taken from [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/). The first one was a [Theoretical Physics collaboration dataset](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepTh.html) and the second one was the [Email communication network of Enron](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Enron.html), just to note how Giraph scales for large graphs. Also, I have made my ways through the Maven Build System, after starting from absolute 0 last week. Since I had a hard time googling a lot, I have thought of writing something about the Giraph API, to help people starters in Graph analytics, like me!
