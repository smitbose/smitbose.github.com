Life now has taken strange turns, with me probably heading for the most crucial part of my career! So I thought of starting my own blog, covering all the interesting and even well not-so-interesting things that I come across everyday.

Found Jekyll an easy way to blog. Just creating a new file, and a git push, and there we go with a new post!!
